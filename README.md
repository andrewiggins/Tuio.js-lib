Tuio.js-lib
===========

This project is a copy of the Tuio.js Node library. The difference between this
and the other repository is that this repo only contains the tuio package and
not the development and example cruft. This separation was to allow the adding
of features without having to download the entire development suite of tools.

Features Added

* Debug optional initialization parameter to print out TUIO messages the UDP
